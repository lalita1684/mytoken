# My Token

This Solidity code serves as a straightforward example for crafting a custom token, showcasing essential features like minting and burning. Its aim is to help novice Solidity learners grasp the fundamental concepts of the programming language.

## Description

This Solidity script is a basic contract designed for the Ethereum blockchain, employing the Solidity programming language. It includes two functions: "mint," which generates tokens for a designated user, and "burn," responsible for eliminating tokens for the user initiating the action.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., mytoken.sol). Copy and paste the code from [mytoken](mytoken.sol)

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile mytoken.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "mytoken" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the different functions present in it.
