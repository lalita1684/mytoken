# My Token

This is a simple Solidity code that shows how to create a custom token with basic features like making and destroying tokens. It is designed to help beginners learn the core concepts of Solidity programming language.

## Description

This Solidity code serves as a fundamental contract tailored for the Ethereum blockchain, using the Solidity programming language. It consists of two functions: "mint," which creates tokens for a specified user, and "burn," which removes tokens for the user triggering the action.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., mytoken.sol). Copy and paste the code from [mytoken](mytoken.sol)

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile mytoken.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "mytoken" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the different functions present in it.
